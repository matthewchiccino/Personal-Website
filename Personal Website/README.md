# Personal Website README

## Overview
This is a my personal website. Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of the project structure:

- **HTML Files**: Each file is a different page on the site.
- **PanelCollapse.js**: Manages the logic for collapsing the left panel. (I tried to use as little JS as possible)
- **styles.css**: generic styling used in every page
- **Unique css files**: Some pages have their own specific styles.
- **assets**: A folder with various resources used on the site. Pictures, icons, documents, etc etc
