# Personal Website README

## Overview
This is a my personal website. It is how I taught myself html and css from scratch. I will be an up-to-date work-in-progress collection
of relevent professional infromation, personal information I feel like sharing, and a display of my _humble_ frontend skills.

Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of the project structure:

- **HTML Files**: Each file is a different page on the site.
- **Functionality**: Some basic Javascript functions to do things like close the left panel. (I tried to use as little JS as possible)
- **styles.css**: generic styling used in every page
- **Unique css files**: Some pages have their own specific styles.
- - **assets**: A folder with various resources used on the site. Pictures, icons, documents, etc etc
