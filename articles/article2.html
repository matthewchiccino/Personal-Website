                <h2 id="title">The Problem with College in America</h2>
                <p id="name">By Matthew Chiccino</p>
                <p>Education is really important, but systems are pretty flawed here in the US. Here are my thoughts on what's done wrong.</p>
                
               
                <h3>1. Growth vs. Enrollment</h3>

                <p>
                    For those who don't know, private institutions don't fund their schools directly 
                    from tuition payments. Instead, they have pools of money which they invest and grow. 
                    This is called their endowment. The returns from these investments are used to fund 
                    operations across the school. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many schools like mine (Boston University) don’t disclose how or where this money 
                    is invested. This lack of transparency makes me inclined to believe it's tied to 
                    industries or companies which contradict BUs public message around ethics, equity, 
                    and sustainability.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    The size of these endowments are shocking. Harvard alone has an endowment of over 
                    $50 billion. This is more than most countries entire GDP!! In just the past 5 years, their endowment grew 32%. However, their 
                    class size in the past five years increased 0%. From 1985 to now, their endowment 
                    grew 435%, but they only increased the size of their incoming class by 4%. 
                    (<a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/institution-profile/166027" target="_blank" class="common-link">source</a>)
                    The almost one trillion dollars in endowments held by private schools in the US, growing well beyond the rate of inflation,
                    would lead you to believe they are decreasing the cost of attendence. Of course, the opposite is true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professor Scott Galloway explains a process called the LVMH strategy. This is the 
                    idea of artificially constraining supply to create scarcity and aspiration. Therefore 
                    the ability to raise 
                    prices at an accelerated rate. This is exactly what private institutions are doing.  
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Old Homeowners do the same thing with housing through efforts to prevent new home 
                    building permits. Designer brands are entirely built on this principle of intentional 
                    scarcity. Here is my strong opinion: The education in my country is NOT a Birkin bag. 
                    Education in my country should not fall 
                    to the fate of fiscal greed. If a college's endowment grows faster than their enrollment, 
                    they are no longer a school, they are a hedge fund that offers classes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Northeastern University is a great example of abusing this process. This year 
                    Northeastern university received 105,000 applications for their undergraduate programs, 
                    each application costing $75. This is a ridiculous amount of money which then 
                    gets respent to promote more applicants; just to reject them and push down their acceptance 
                    rate. Acceptance rate is the largest metric of prestige of US colleges. In my eyes 
                    this is the quality of education being determined by a game of 
                    appearances and fraudulent value. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    2. Perpetuating Privlege
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My second argument is that elite higher education actually 
                    perpetuates privilege and deepens inequality. I assume that higher education is 
                    meant to be gateway to opportunity. But I believe it serves as a gatekeeper of status and 
                    elevates the already advantaged. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The admissions process favors kids from high income areas with 
                    resources to expensive test prep, elite prep schools, legacy admission, and donors. 
                    Clearly this leads to a self-selected class of students who aren't particularly 
                    exceptional, but rather exceptionally well off. This isn't a meritocracy, this is reinforcing 
                    a hierarchy. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a proponent of DEI initiatives and affirmative action because they challange this issue. That said, 
                    I believe there are ways we can improve these efforts to better serve those most in need. My school prides 
                    itself on its global and cultural diversity. 

                    However, I've noticed this often comes in the form of enrolling ultra wealthy international students 
                    who can spend an even higher premium on the already undiscounted tuition. Global representation is valuable, but 
                    I worry that this is a financially strategic appoach instead of a genuine commitment to equity. It disallocates 
                    resrouces to students who face real barriers to entry and access to opprotunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think Affirmative action would be more effective with stronger emphasis on socioeconomic backgrounds. 
                    The top 1% aren’t in dire need for more doors to be opened for them. Instead we should prioritize 
                    the bottom 90% and give them the tools to rise. That, to me, is what educational equity looks like.
                </p>
                <p>   
                    To me, it seems that the objective of top institutions is identifying a superclass of individuals and 
                    accelerating their path to disproportionate opportunities and wealth. My opinion is that there are no 
                    valid indicators of who is deserving of this at 17 years old. This system of spending, conditioning, and 
                    pressuring children to meet arbitrary standards is not an accurate measurement of ability nor worthiness. 
                    Instead, it is an unfair judgment that unfortunately favors privilege and perpetuates wealth inequality 
                    and unfairness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    May I bitter I didn't get accepted into an ivy league, and do I attend a rich private 
                    school? perhaps. But I am an advocate for education, decency, and meritocracy. A society's 
                    level of education is correlated to economic growth 
                    (<a href="https://xqsuperschool.org/education-policy/how-important-is-education-for-economic-growth/" target="_blank" class="common-link">source</a>). 
                    Education is not something we 
                    should restrict, its something we need to expand. Focusing on privilege and profit, and scarcity
                    undermines the sole purpose of education, and that's what I see as the issue with colleges, specifically prestigious private colleges, in America.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Further fund public schools.</li>
                    <li>Make endowment payout minimums. </li>
                    <li>Require schools to disclose how and where endowments are invested. </li>
                    <li>Ban commercialization of college applications: No marketing for the sake of lowe acceptance.</li>
                    <li>Emphasis on econimic-based affirmative action</li>
                </ul>
