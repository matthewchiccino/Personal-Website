                <h2 id="title">Landing my First SWE Internship - What Worked and What Didn't</h2>
                <p id="name">By Matthew Chiccino</p>
                
                <p>
                    Before I begin I’d like to acknowledge that I don’t claim to be an expert 
                    on software engineering, the tech market, or any of that matter. In fact I
                     haven’t even started my first job as a SWE at the time of writing this. 
                     But I have spent a large amount of time and effort strategizing ways to 
                     break into the Industry and to land a position as an SWE intern. Therefore 
                     I think I can offer a helpful and relatable perspective, especially compared 
                     to all the tech gurus you find online. With that out of the way, ill begin.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Introduction
                </h3>

                <p>
                    A couple of weeks ago I finally received an offer as a Software Engineer Intern
                    at a large (non tech) company. If you’re reading this, I'm sure you're aware of
                    the process this involves. You’ve probably followed creators who’s entire brand
                    is about breaking into tech, bootcamp advertisements, things you must to do ever 
                    be looked at by a recruiter, the list goes on and on. You’ve also probably heard 
                    that the tech market is in shambles, a computer science degree is worthless, or 
                    the industry is oversaturated. 
                </p> 
                <p>  
                    I’m not qualified to make judgments about 
                    macroeconomics or large company’s future hiring habits. But what I do know is that
                    while it is difficult, it is still entirrely possible to break into the industry. After 
                    seeing myself and many of my friends do it, while having little to no experience; 
                    I’ll touch on what worked, what i’ve learned, and what i would tell someone or tell 
                    myself just a few months ago, to help with the goal of landing an internship in Software 
                    Engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Disclaimer: This is based on my personal experience. I'm sure there are many paths to 
                    succeed, this is just what i've learned.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Getting Lost in the Details
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The first large piece of advice I have is it's important to not get caught up perfecting 
                    every little detail you've been told will get you hired. It’s not the small tweaks to your 
                    resume, GitHub profile, or personal website that will make the difference between if you 
                    get hired or not. Sure, your resume should effectively highlight your credentials; that goes 
                    without saying. But spending hours hyper-optimizing its format or phrasing won’t set you 
                    apart from the other applicants. Software Engineer Intern roles can get thousands, even 
                    tens of thousands of applications. In this case, your resume is nowhere near a determining 
                    factor. Instead, you need to change someone’s opinion about you before they even look at 
                    your resume. And unfortunately, that's basically impossible with cold applications. If you 
                    don’t give people a reason to care, your resume will likely get lost in that digital pile 
                    in the tens of thousands. Yes, you should have good grades, build projects, and develop 
                    marketable skills. But just checking those boxes isn’t enough to guarantee you a job. 
                    Everyone is doing that. To stand out, you need to do more. You can have great skills, but 
                    it doesn’t matter if nobody notices, which brings me to my next point.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Your Number One Priority Should Be to Be Seen
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Opportunity comes from visibility. For the role I eventually landed, I met the recruiter 
                    at a career fair. I didn’t get the job because my resume was perfectly formatted or because 
                    I had every keyword to pass ATS scans. I didn’t even get the job because of the fancy 
                    clipboard that I had with me. What got me the interview was leaving a good impression (and 
                    having my phone number on my resume, which he used to call me shortly after.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can spend months building an incredibly impressive project using the most marketable 
                    technologies. That’s great, but it won’t help you if nobody sees it. Having a link to this 
                    project in a stack of 25,000 digital resumes isn’t going to help either. What will help is 
                    putting your work in front of the right people. What I'm trying to say is, Nobody is going 
                    to come across your potential unless you actually show it to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Visibility may seem super difficult, but I think that's because people's idea of visibility 
                    is convoluted. It’s not about random LinkedIn connections or cold emails. It’s about putting 
                    yourself in the right places. Whether it’s career fairs, coffee chats, or casual interactions 
                    in public, being likable and leaving a good impression will get you infinitely further than 
                    just having a strong technical skill set with no visibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soft skills are incredibly important, even in tech. That could mean presenting your work, 
                    attending certain events, or reaching out to the right people. It may seem too difficult 
                    online, but I’m confident there is a very small number of people making genuine impressions 
                    with the people who can get the role you want.
                </p>



                <h3>
                    Specialization
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Passion makes you memorable. The best way to stand out isn’t to follow a perfect formula; it’s 
                    to find something you find interesting, and get really, really good at it. If you’re passionate 
                    about something and can demonstrate exceptional knowedge in, you’ll naturally differentiate 
                    yourself from the crowd.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you're making these meaningful connections that I keep stressing, this will give you 
                    something valuable to talk about. Even if it isn’t the main thing they're looking for in a 
                    position. For internships, in my opinion, they're not looking for someone with a honed skillset 
                    for a specific project. They're looking for someone who can show they are genuinely interested 
                    and competent in something. Specializing in a certain area is a much more effective way to do 
                    this than trying to broadly cover every subfield of software engineering.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Rejection and Iteration
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The reality is this job search is tough, especially when it feels like you're facing rejection 
                    after rejection. Realistically, this is something you’ll need to get used to. I personally 
                    applied to 30-40 internships without ever receiving a single offer from an online application. 
                    Some of my friends have applied to hundreds with similar results. Rejection is part of the 
                    process. You likely won't hear back at all, get automatically rejected, or, by some miracle, 
                    you might get an automated online assessment used to collect data. Each rejection can feel 
                    like a dead-end, and it's easy to lose hope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I often hear people saying it's simply a numbers game. I also believed this mentality when I 
                    was applying earlier on. Of course, you can blindly apply to a very large number of random 
                    companies and hope that one of the blindfolded darts hits. But my suggestion is different. 
                    Spend time thinking about how you can best leverage the opportunities around you. Your personal 
                    connections, your school, previous workplaces, etc. Look into local companies or target companies 
                    that prefer to hire from your school. Look for roles that align more with your strengths and 
                    background. All this takes time, but that effort is what gives you an edge over the people 
                    blindly throwing darts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The title of this section is "Rejection and Iteration," and that’s because not every plan will 
                    work. But my advice remains: spending time on each approach to a job or company, whether through 
                    networking or targeted applications, will be a much better use of your time than mass applying.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Conclusion
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If I could go back a year and give myself advice, it wouldn’t be about perfecting my resume or 
                    grinding one more LeetCode problem. It would just be this: get outside and be visible. Stop watching 
                    content about the things you need to do to improve your chances. None of those things actually move 
                    the needle. Breaking into tech is not about being flawless, and that 
                    mindset will only hold you back. Instead it’s a lot more like most other jobs. Being present, 
                    persistent, and real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People remember genuine connections, not perfect formatting. I believe recruiters value confidence, 
                    curiosity, and authenticity. So embody those qualities. Show up, be approachable, and stay eager to 
                    learn. Chances are, you already have these traits. Reprioritize your efforts, and I beleive the right 
                    opportunities will come.
