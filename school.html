                    <h2>CS111 - Intro to Computer Science I</h2>
                    <p>This was the first CS class I took in college. Though I already had experience
                        coding in python, this class is where I developed "computational problem-solving 
                        skills" in a formal setting. We covered topics like object-oriented 
                        programming and recursion.  These concepts were applied through increasingly complex weekly 
                        problem sets, leaving me with a much stronger foundation in 
                        programming than when I started.</p>
                    <p>Difficulty: 4/10</p>
                    <p>Grade: B+</p>

                    <h2>CS112 - Intro to Computer Science II</h2>
                    <p>This class was Data Structures and Algorithms, where I first built upon the 
                        foundations of object-oriented programming and recursion, this time using 
                        Java. Then, the class covered the major topics in DSA including algorithm 
                        analysis, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, and hashing. We also 
                        covered a variety of algorithms for searching and sorting.</p>

                        <h2>CS210 - Computer Systems</h2>
                        <p>In CS210, we gained a deep understanding of how computer systems work. 
                            We began at the level of binary signals and built up our understanding of 
                            each level up to low level programming languages.
                            The course covered the circuits, CPU design, ISA/assembly 
                            programming, and C. We also covered topics in
                            operating systems such as memory-management/caching, virtual memory, and
                            various performative practices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This class bridged the gap between hardware and software, and provided me with
                            a strong overall understanding of a computer. This has been my favorite CS
                            class i've taken at BU.
                        </p>

                        <h2>CS330 - Algorithms</h2>
                        <p>Coming soon...</p>
                    <hr></hr>
                    <h2>CS131 - Discrete Math/Combinatoric Structures</h2>
                    <p>This class is a notoriously difficult one in the program, known
                        to challenge students abstract reasoning to make formal mathematical 
                        proofs. We focused on representing and analyzing combinatorial structures commonly used in computer science.

                    <h2>CS132 - Linear Algebra/Geometric Algorithms</h2>
                        <p>In Linear Algebra we covered the fundamental concepts of LA within the computer science department.
                            I enjoyed this class because I believe it had an emphasis on practical application.
                            We applied principles of LA to advanced topics such as Linear Models, Computer Graphics, Markov Chains, and more.
